# CHANGELOG

### Features
* Data/Web: Reticulum protocol support — `PROTOCOL=reticulum` selects a passive RNS announce listener that ingests `lxmf.delivery`/`nomadnetwork.node` announces as `protocol="reticulum"` nodes; the web app whitelists the protocol end-to-end (ingest + `?protocol=` filter), serves live `reticulum` stats scopes and activity-series keys, signs a live `reticulum_nodes_count` on the federation wire (the v2 canonical already carried the field, so peer signatures are unaffected), and renders reticulum nodes across the UI (icon, filter chip, mesh-activity row, federation column) (SPEC S6/FS2/MA5/MA-F2/F2-2 as amended)

### Fixes
* Web: live-driven dashboard refreshes (SSE pings, resync, safety poll, unpause) are now coalesced behind a single in-flight guard, so a burst or an overlapping trigger can no longer fire two refreshes at once; the SSE-ping debounce also widens from 250ms to 1000ms (overridable via `LIVE_DEBOUNCE_MS`) (SPEC PS3/PS4)

## v0.7.5

### Features
* Make the activity announcement opt-in via ANNOUNCE (default off) by @seybsen in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/886>

### Fixes
* **Ingestor: every mesh transmission is now off by default** (`TX_ENABLED`, default `0`), covering the activity announcement *and* the MeshCore on-air contact telemetry polls; announcements take a second opt-in (`TX_ANNOUNCE=1`) on top by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
* Ingestor: **`RX_ONLY` no longer fails open** — it was compared as an exact `== "1"`, so `RX_ONLY=true`, `TRUE`, `yes`, `on` and `" 1"` all silently resolved to *off* and a receive-only listening post transmitted anyway; all TX flags now accept the common spellings, strip whitespace, and resolve an unrecognized value toward silence by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
* Ingestor: the `TX_*` flags reach every packaged deployment — `docker-compose.yml`, `data/Dockerfile`, the NixOS module (`txEnabled`/`txAnnounce`) and `.env.example`; the previous `ANNOUNCE` opt-in reached none of them, so setting it in `.env` had no effect at all by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
* Ingestor: the announcement's 24 h anti-spam delay is measured on a monotonic clock — it used wall clock, so on an RTC-less host a post-boot NTP step cleared it instantly by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
* Ingestor: transmit policy is stated in the log at startup without `DEBUG=1`, and each suppressed announcement names the gate that closed by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
* App: await the in-flight request before closing its HTTP client in `loadMessages`/`loadNodes` — the unawaited return let `finally` close the client mid-request by @l5yth
* App: raise the iOS deployment target to **15.0** (from 14.0) in the Podfile, Xcode project and `AppFrameworkInfo.plist` — Flutter 3.47's `Flutter` pod requires it, and `pod install` could not resolve against the old target. **Drops support for iOS 14 devices.** by @l5yth
* CI: the Mobile workflow matrix no longer fails fast, so an iOS failure stops hiding whether the Android build passed by @l5yth
* Docs: README gains a **Transmitting on the mesh** section — what each flag turns on, the truth table, the literal announcement text, and what is never gated by @l5yth in <https://github.com/l5yth/potato-mesh/pull/891>
